# nicksReactPortfolio

Using React I have created a profile/bio page that I can not only showcase my skills with React upon, but I can also show off my other projects and inlcude my resume and have ways for people to contact me.

## Installation

-Once the repository is downloaded simply run "npm install" to get all of the files and modules you need.  At that point you can use npm start to run it on a local host or you can deploy the page to GitHub or any other site that you can deploy a repository from.  For my site I used the following steps for GitHub.

-npm install -D gh-pages

-At this point you do want to make sure you have the necessary hompage and scripts added to your package.json file.  The homepage will be your GitHub page once deployed "homepage": "http://<username>.github.io/<name-of-repository and then you want to make sure the necessary scripts are added.
  
-npm run deploy

And you are off!

## Usage

This can be used to showcase your talents as a webdeveloper or just as a site for other people to get to know you better (but you can show off your web development skills at the same time)
